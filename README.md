# 🚀 QueueLess

QueueLess is a full-stack MERN application that digitizes traditional waiting lines by allowing customers to join queues remotely while enabling businesses to manage queues efficiently through a real-time dashboard.

The platform eliminates physical waiting, provides live queue tracking, estimates waiting time, and synchronizes queue updates instantly using Socket.IO.

Events synchronized in real time:

- Customer joins queue
- Queue position updates
- Estimated wait updates
- Serve next customer
- Queue open/close status

---

# ⏱️ Estimated Wait Time

QueueLess estimates customer waiting time dynamically.

```
Estimated Wait

=

People Ahead × Average Service Time
```

Each business maintains an average service time, allowing customers to receive a realistic estimate immediately after joining the queue.

The estimate automatically updates whenever the queue changes.

# 🗄️ Database Models

## User

```javascript
{
    name,
    email,
    password,
    role
}
```

---

## Business

```javascript
{
    name,
    code,
    ownerId,
    queueOpen,
    currentToken,
    averageServiceTime
}
```

---

## Queue

```javascript
{
    businessId,
    customers:[
        {
            customerId,
            tokenNumber,
            status,
            joinedAt
        }
    ]
}
```

# 🔐 Security

- JWT Authentication
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Protected API routes
- Owner-only queue management
- Business ownership verification
- Duplicate active queue prevention
- Secure authorization middleware

---

# ⚙️ Engineering Decisions

### Role-Based Authentication

Customers and business owners have separate permissions enforced through JWT authentication and backend authorization middleware.

---

### Owner Isolation

Each owner can only access and manage their own business.

Backend ownership checks prevent unauthorized queue management.

---

### Duplicate Queue Prevention

Customers can hold only one active queue token per business.

This prevents accidental duplicate entries while still allowing users to rejoin after being served.

---

### Dynamic Wait-Time Estimation

Estimated wait time is calculated dynamically using queue position and each business's average service time rather than storing static values.

---

### Real-Time Synchronization

Socket.IO broadcasts queue updates instantly so all connected users receive live changes without manually refreshing the application.

---

### Single Source of Truth

Queue state is derived from customer statuses instead of maintaining multiple synchronized lists, reducing data inconsistency.
